    <h2>How to Make Blueberry Muffins</h2>
    <p>This blueberry muffin recipe is moist, sweet, and bursting with fruity flavor. A buttery streusel topping takes
        this indulgent breakfast over the top.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cup blueberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 8 muffin cups or line with paper liners.</li>
        <li>For the muffins: Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour oil into a small liquid measuring cup. Add egg and enough milk to reach the 1-cup mark; stir until
            combined. Pour into flour mixture and mix just until batter is combined. Fold in blueberries; set batter
            aside.</li>
        <li>For the crumb topping: Combine sugar, flour, butter, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Mix with a fork until
            crumbly.</li>
        <li>Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling right to the top. Sprinkle with crumb topping.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25
            minutes.</li>
    </ol>
